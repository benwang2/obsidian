## Instructions
Please read and follow these instructions carefully.  
1. You must work on this problem set individually.  
2. Please complete your answers to the questions below and upload your responses to Canvas  
as a single PDF file.  
3. Your answers (preferably typed up rather than handwritten) must be clear, legible, and con-  
cise. If we cannot understand your answer with reasonable effort, you will get zero credit.  
4. If you leave a question out or clearly state “I don’t know”, you will receive 25% of the points  
for that question.  
5. We care not just about your final answer, but also how you approach the questions. In  
general, if you show us your reasoning for your answers, we will do our best to provide  
partial credit even if your final answer is incorrect. However, if you provide no reasoning,  
and your answer turns out to be incorrect, you will typically receive zero points. So, please  
explain yourself.  
6. You are free to discuss the problem set on Piazza or through other means with your peers  
and the instructors. You may refer to the course materials, textbook, and resources on the  
Internet for a deeper understanding of topics. However, you cannot lift solutions from other  
students or from the web. Do not post these problems to question-answering services like  
Chegg. All written solutions must be your own. We run sophisticated software to detect  
plagiarism and carefully monitor student answers.  
7. There is a due date/time but no “time limit” on problem sets. That is, you may take as long  
as you need to work on problem sets, as long as you submit them on time. Further, you may  
make an unlimited number of submissions on Canvas.  
8. As a response to the last question of this problem set, please specify who you collaborated  
with, and also include all the resources you consulted to answer questions in this problem set,  
including URLs of pages you visited on the Internet. Also specify which question and aspect  
you got help with. Please be as thorough and complete as possible here. It is mandatory to  
answer this question.  
9. If you have any questions or clarifications on the problem set, please post them on Piazza or  
contact the course staff. We are here to help.
