## Congestion Control

The internet uses a **distributed algorithm** to converge to an **efficient** and **fair** outcome.

With this algorithm, each endpoint acts on its own - there is no central vantage point or control.

To make the controMaximize the amount of bottleneck capacity used, even with a single TCP connection.

To make the congestion control *fair*, we share the bottleneck capacity equitably.
