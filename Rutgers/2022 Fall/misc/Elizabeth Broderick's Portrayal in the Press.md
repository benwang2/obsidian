# From Social Butterfly to Modern-Day Medea: Elizabeth Broderick's Portrayal in the Press
**Author**: Alexandra Halkias

## Context
Medea plays the archetypal role of helper-maiden, aiding Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece by using her magic to save his life out of love. Once he finished his quest, she abandons her native home of Colchis, and flees westwards with Jason, where they eventually settle in Corinth and get married. Euripides's 5th-century BCE tragedy Medea, depicts the ending of said union with Jason, when after ten years of marriage, Jason abandons her to wed king Creon's daughter Creusa. Medea and her sons by Jason are to be banished from Corinth. In revenge, she murders Creusa with poisoned gifts. Later, she murders her own sons by Jason before fleeing for Athens, where she eventually marries king Aegeus. 

In short: Medea falls in love with Jason and moves in with him. After ten years of marriage, Jason leaves her to wed Creon's daughter, Creusa. In revenge, Medea murders Creusa with poisoned gifts, and then goes on to kill her own sons. Following her spree of murders, she flees to Athens to marry king Aegeus.

## Themes
- Deviation from normative heterosexual gender roles
- U.S. national press coverage relying on stereotypes to cut corners
- Press focuses on creating a story as opposed to accurately reporting

## Notes
The delivery of this information is written in such a way to draw attention to the relationship between Elizabeth and Daniel Broderick - a husband and his ex-wife. Despite that there are two murder victims, the media only describes Elizabeth and Daniel in depth, quickly glossing over Daniel's newlywed wife.

The story is not about the murder victims, but the murderer themselves. Linda is an afterthought, a "secondary element in the construction" of "this drama" (292).

Linda is discussed only in relation to Daniel in the media; again and again she is portrayed as a "supporting character", having emphasis placed on her innocence.

By pitching this story as a *murderous ex-wife* targeting a picturesque husband-and-wife, the press easily plays into the demonization of Elizabeth Broderick. The way they pitch the story undeniably appeals to pathos, whether it's intentional or not.
