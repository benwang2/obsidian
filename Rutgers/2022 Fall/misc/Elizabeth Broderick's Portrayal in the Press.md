**Author**: Alexandra Halkias

## Context
Medea plays the archetypal role of helper-maiden, aiding Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece by using her magic to save his life out of love. Once he finished his quest, she abandons her native home of Colchis, and flees westwards with Jason, where they eventually settle in Corinth and get married. Euripides's 5th-century BCE tragedy Medea, depicts the ending of said union with Jason, when after ten years of marriage, Jason abandons her to wed king Creon's daughter Creusa. Medea and her sons by Jason are to be banished from Corinth. In revenge, she murders Creusa with poisoned gifts. Later, she murders her own sons by Jason before fleeing for Athens, where she eventually marries king Aegeus. 

In short: Medea falls in love with Jason and moves in with him. After ten years of marriage, Jason leaves her to wed Creon's daughter, Creusa. In revenge, Medea murders Creusa with poisoned gifts, and then goes on to kill her own sons. Following her spree of murders, she flees to Athens to marry king Aegeus.
