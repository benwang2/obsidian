    "4. The values in the Android version column should be floats. Strip the trailing non-numeric characters from all values (ie. the words “ and up”), so the result is a number. If there are multiple decimal places (eg. “x.y.z”), keep only the first two parts (eg “x.y”). For example, the value “4.1 and up” should be changed to “4.1”. The value “4.5.6 and up” should be changed to “4.5”. The value “5.6.7” should be changed to “5.6”. If there is a range (eg. 5.0 – 8.0), only consider the first number. For example, the value “5.0 – 8.0” should be changed to “5.0”. The value “4.0.3 – 7.1.1” should be changed to “4.0”."
