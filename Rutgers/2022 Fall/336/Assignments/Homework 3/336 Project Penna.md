## Part 1 - 30%
**Powering simple interface to Penna table**


### API1(candidate, timestamp, precinct)
Given a candidate C, timestamp T and precinct P, return how many votes did the candidate C have at T or largest timestamp Tâ€™ smaller than T, in case T does not appear in Penna.
```mysql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS API1;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION API1(
	c VARCHAR(6),
    ts Timestamp,
    p VARCHAR(50)
) RETURNS INT DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	RETURN (SELECT
		CASE
			WHEN c='Biden' THEN c
            ELSE Trump
		END AS Votes
        FROM Penna
        WHERE precinct=p AND Timestamp <= ts
        ORDER BY Timestamp DESC
        LIMIT 1
	);
END;$$
```
### API2(date)
Given a date, return the candidate who had the most votes at the last timestamp for this date as well as  how many votes he got. For example the last timestamp for 2020-11-06 will be 2020-11-06 23:51:43.

```mysql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS API2;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION API2(
	d VARCHAR(10)
) RETURNS VARCHAR(6) DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	SELECT IF(Biden>Trump, "Biden", "Trump") AS Candidate
    FROM Penna
    WHERE Timestamp LIKE CONCAT(d," %")
    ORDER BY Timestamp DESC
    LIMIT 1;
END;$$
```

### API3(candidate)
Given a candidate return top 10 precincts that this candidate won. Order precincts by total votes and list TOP 10 in descending order of totalvotes.

### API4(precinct)
Given a precinct, show who won this precinct (Trump or Biden) as well as what percentage of total votes went to the winner.

## API5(string)
Given a string $s$ of characters, create a stored procedure which determines who won more votes in all precincts whose names contain this string s and how many votes did they get in total. For example, for s='Township', the procedure will return the name (Trump or Biden) who won more votes in union of precints which have "Township" in their name as well as the sum of votes for the winner.
