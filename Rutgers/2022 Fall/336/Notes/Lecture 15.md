## Topics Covered
- NoSQL

## NoSQL databases
NoSQL implements semistructured data and is better for unstructured data that needs to be scalable.

### Not First Normal Form
A relational database must be in first normal form, but a NoSQL database does not have to conform to normal form.

### Benefits
NoSQL databases can contain a lot of different types:
- HTML
- Images
- Text

#### Denormalization
With NoSQL, every resource is not required to have an attribute or to be *normalized*. We don't have to worry about relations as much because there's no need for artificially created tables.

### Detriments
However, **there's no standard query language** for NoSQL databases. A lot of features that are standard in SQL are not implemented in NoSQL.
