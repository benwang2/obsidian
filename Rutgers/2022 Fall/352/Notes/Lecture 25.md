## Topic
As the professor begins to explain the topic, use this space to write an overview of the topic being discussed.

## Information retrieval
- Non-boolean
- Google search, where documents are ranked by relevancy (partial measure)
- No 1 or 0
- It is "in between" 0 and 1

## Ranked retrieval
**Benefits**
- Documents either match or don't
- Good for expert users with precise understanding of their needs and the collection
- Also good for applications: Applications can easily consume 1000s of results
**Cons**
- Not good for majority of users
- Most users incapable of writing boolean queries
- Most users don't want to wade through 1000s of searches

With a ranked list, number of records does not matter.
Rank documents by how well each document "matches" the query

TF-IDF "term frequency inverse document freq"


## Quiz for next week
- Mongo and NoSQL databases are far better fit for procedural languages
- SQL has different logic from other programming languages
