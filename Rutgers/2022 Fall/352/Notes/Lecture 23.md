## Control plane
The control plane is **distributed** throughout routers. Components in every router interact with other components to produce a routing outcome. 

Data plane performs per-packet processing, moving packet from input port to output port.

Routing algorithms work over an abstract representation of the network, called **the graph abstraction**.
