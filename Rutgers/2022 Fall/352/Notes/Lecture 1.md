# Lecture 1
## Network
A network is a carrier of information between two or more entities.

Entities may be **hosts** or **endpoints**. Some examples are:
- cell phone
- laptop
- wifi printer
- router

#hosts, #endpoints

The interconnection between entities is any physical medium capable of carrying information: **links**
- wireless links: cellular 4G/5G, wifi 802.11, bluetooth, satellite
- wired links: copper wire, lasers over optic fiber, coax cables

#links

### Single Link Multiple Access Network
In a single link multiple access network, data is sent in **packets** or **frames**.

Networks differentiate receivers using a link level address, called a **MAC address**

On a link, digital data must be converted to physical signals over medium, using encoding and decoding.

Control over information transmission is called medium access control.

Follows a "peer-to-peer" model, where each device is reaches another device with a *single link*.
