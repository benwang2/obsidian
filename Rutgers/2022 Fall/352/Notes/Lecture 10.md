# Transport Layer Protocols
## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
UDP functions as a simple wrapper around packet delivrey.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
TCP provides delivery guarantees for ordering, efficiency, and fair bandwidth use.

# Multiplexing
Multiplexing is a way of sending multiple signals or streams of information over a communications link at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal.

# Demultiplexing
Demultiplexing is the process of reconverting a signal containing multiple analog or digital signal streams back into the original separate and unrelated signals

Each packet has a source IP and destination IP, with the source port and destination port. The transport layer utilizes demultiplexing to obtain this information and deliver the packet to its destinatoin effectively.
