## Overview
In this assignment, you’ll implement a prototype movie recommendation program in Python according to the following guidelines. You can work individually or in a group of up to 4 people.

## What to Submit
Write all the required functions described below in the given template file named hw1.py, and submit your completed hw1.py. If you are working in a group, only one person should submit, and your hw1.py file should have a comment that gives the names and netIDs of everyone in your group.
You can resubmit any number of times. The last submission will be graded. 
You may also implement other helper functions as needed. Make sure you write all your test calls  
in the main() function. Do not write any code outside of any of the functions. We’ll ignore your  
main() function when grading.

## How to test your code  
You can test your program by calling your functions in the hw1.py file. All test code must be in the main() function. 
$\qquad$ Make sure the test files are in the same folder as the program. You may develop and test your  
code in a Jupyter notebook, but for submission you will need to move your code over to hw1.py and  
execute it as above to make sure it works correctly.  
You can run your tests on the given ratings and movies files, but testing on only these files may  
not be sufficient. You should make your own test files as well, to make sure that you cover the various  
paths of logic in your functions. You are not required to submit any of your test files.  
You may assume that all parameter values given to your functions will be valid. Also, in any  
function that requires the returned values to be sorted or ranked, ties may be broken arbitrarily  
between equal values.
